- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Test with wireshark




















### Implementation checkpoint 4/9 **

Video showing implementation:
https://github.com/JeffBship/CS490-Group2-Final-Project/blob/Implentation-Checkpoint/Submission.mp4

Instructions to recreate:  
Open 2 instances of an IDE (ie Netbeans), or open the project on 2 computers (must be on the same local network).  
Run the file **RDTack.java**  make note of the local IP.  
RDTack has some built in testing functions, and will only ACK the percent of packets shown.  The rest will be dropped.  
This percentage can be adjusted by altering line 22 of the code.  
There is a built in delay to simulate slow networks.  The delay time and variation percentage can be adjusted by altering lines 23-24 of the code.  


This file is purposefully on an infinite loop.  It will continue to receive and process packets until killed.

Run the main project.  This will send a big string to the client.





Implementation **checkpoint** â€“ P2P client to directory server protocol

Code and comments for implementation of protocol of P2P client to directory server message transfer using UDP
Checkpoint does not actually need to do any sort of directory listing or update, but needs to be able to reliably transfer a multipart message.

Include a detailed description of how to run the implementation;
